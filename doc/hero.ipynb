(1998): Multiobjective Optimization Using Evolutionary Algorithms - A Comparative Case Study. Parallel Problem Solving from Nature (PPSN-V), 292-301. A more detailed discussion can be found in Zitzler, E., Thiele, L., Laumanns, M., Fonseca, C., and Grunert da Fonseca, V (2003): Performance Assessment of Multiobjective Optimizers: An Analysis and Review. IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 7(2), 117-132.\n","\n","In order to compare and rank the set of algorithms used, we use the hypervolume indicator $I_H^-$ in the metrics space. This indicator calculates the volume (in the metrics space) covered by members of a non-dominated set of solutions $W$. With this in mind, let $v_i$ be the volume enclosed by solution $w_i \\in W$ . Then, a union of all hypercubes is found and its hypervolume ($I_H$) is calculated.\n","\n","$I_H(W)=\\bigcup_1^{\\left| W \\right|} v_i$\n","\n","The hypervolume of a set is measured relative to a reference point, usually the anti-optimal point or \"worst possible\" point in space. We do not address here the problem of choosing a reference point; if the anti-optimal point is not known or does not exist, one suggestion is to take in each objective the worst value from any of the fronts being compared. If a set $W_i$ has a greater hypervolume than a set $W_j$, then $W_i$ is taken to be a better set of solutions than $W_j$. In this work, we consider the hypervolume difference to a reference set $R$, defined as\n","\n","$I_H^-(W)=I_H(R)-I_H(W)$\n","\n","where smaller values correspond to higher quality. If the reference set is not given, we take $I_H(R)=0$.\n","\n","In the case of the `UnaryHyperVolume` class, minimization is assumed. If no reference front is given, all the fronts are normalized to the interval `[1, 2]`, and the reference front is located at `[2.1 ... 2.1]`.
